# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohd Zakir Hussain

🚀 **Data Scientist | GenAI & LLM Specialist | IIT Bombay Grad**

I build intelligent systems that go beyond automation — systems that *reason*, *retrieve*, and *scale*. My focus is on developing **AI agentic solutions** that drive real-world decision-making across industries.

## 💡 About Me

- 🎓 Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) from **IIT Bombay**, with a focus in manufacturing and automation
- 🧠 Passionate about **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, **Agentic Architectures**, and **Data Engineering**
- 🛠️ Bridging the gap between research and scalable deployments using tools like **multi-agent frameworks**, **cloud platforms**, and **containerized pipelines**
- 🧩 Obsessively curious about building clean, efficient, explainable ML pipelines that actually *deliver impact*

## 🧠 Things I've Built

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on production-grade AI systems that include:

- 🧠 **Multi-Agent LLM Architectures** for automating insight synthesis across enterprise data
- 🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solutions tailored to client infrastructure, improving contextual accuracy dramatically
- 🤖 **LLM-based Chatbot Testing Frameworks** to automate quality assurance for virtual agents
- 📦 **Data Processing Pipelines** supporting hierarchical classification, summarization, and PII removal at scale
- 🧪 **Benchmarking Frameworks** for evaluating and selecting LLMs for labeling and classification tasks

These systems are deployed via scalable APIs, Docker containers, and CI/CD pipelines — optimized for observability and performance.
